# Index DIY
Supplementary materials for my PGCon Online 2020 talk "Index DIY".

For large files I used [Yandex.Disk shared folder](https://yadi.sk/d/z9ZbSmp8mM1YSA).
There you can find slides in pptx and pdf formats, some referenced papers and other stuff.

Official documentation is the source of truth. Docs for pluggable index access methods can be found here https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexam.html
