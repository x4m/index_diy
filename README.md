# Index DIY
Supplementary materials for my PGCon 2020 talk "Index DIY".
Until May 27th this file is WIP. I'm still working on contents.

If you have a question and want a detailed answer - please create Issue in this repository. Of course, I will answer all questions from IRC and live QA Zoom session too.

For large files I used [Yandex.Disk shared folder](https://yadi.sk/d/z9ZbSmp8mM1YSA).
There you can find slides in pptx and pdf formats, some referenced papers and other stuff.

Official documentation is the source of truth. Docs for pluggable index access methods can be found here https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexam.html
